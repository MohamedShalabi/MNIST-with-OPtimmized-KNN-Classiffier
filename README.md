# MNIST-with-OPtimmized-KNN-Classiffier
A small Code to check the max accuracy that could be using KNN classifier with a train set of 2000 instances (due to my computer capabilities)
Grid Search has been used to tune the k_neighbours and get the max accuracy
#Second Note(Binary and multi class models with performance optimization) includes Different types of classifiers for:
1--Binar classification for detecting a specific digit(5) and evaluating the classifier performance using precision_recall_curve and ROC curve
2-- Multi classification for detecting all digits(0-9) and evaluating the models with confusion matrix
3--noise cleaner model 
4-- a shifting function for moving any digits at any direction
